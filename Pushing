### Adding files manually
You commit changes to a Git repository in two steps:

Add one or more files to the staging area.
Commit everything in the staging area.
To add a file to the staging area, use 'git add filename'.

### Comparing file state
To compare the state of your files with those in the staging area, you can use git diff -r HEAD. 
The -r flag means "compare to a particular revision", and HEAD is a shortcut meaning "the most recent commit".
